_Object-Oriented Programming_ (OOP) is a widely-used paradigm in software development that organizes code into objects, which represent entities with both **data** (properties) and **behavior** (methods). In this article, we’ll explore how JavaScript implements OOP and how you can leverage this paradigm to write modular, maintainable, and reusable code.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming model based on the concept of objects. These objects can contain data, known as properties, and code, in the form of methods, which represent the behavior associated with the object.

The key principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) together inside an object.
2. **Inheritance**: The ability to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties and behaviors.
3. **Polymorphism**: Objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface, with each object responding differently to the same method call.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality.

## JavaScript and OOP

JavaScript supports OOP principles but with some distinctions. Unlike languages such as Java or C++, which are class-based, JavaScript is prototype-based. However, since ES6, JavaScript introduced the `class` keyword, allowing developers to write class-based OOP code in a more familiar style.

Let’s dive into how OOP concepts work in JavaScript.

### Creating Classes and Objects

Before ES6, JavaScript used constructor functions to define objects. With ES6, you can use the `class` syntax to define classes:

```js showLineNumbers
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name; // Properties
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Method
  greet() {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("John", 30); // Create an instance of the class
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

In the example above:

- The `Person` class has a `constructor()` method that initializes the object’s properties (`name` and `age`).
- The `greet()` method is defined inside the class and can be called on instances of the class.

### Encapsulation in JavaScript

Encapsulation is the practice of restricting access to certain properties or methods. In JavaScript, before ES2020, there was no true way to make properties private, but developers used conventions (like prefixing variables with underscores) to signal that they should not be accessed directly.

Since ES2020, JavaScript supports private fields using the `#` syntax:

```js showLineNumbers
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // Private property

  constructor(owner) {
    this.owner = owner;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
    console.log(`${amount} deposited. New balance: ${this.#balance}`);
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount("Alice");
account.deposit(100); // Output: 100 deposited. New balance: 100
console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 100
// console.log(account.#balance); // Error: Private field '#balance' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

In this example, the `#balance` field is private, meaning it can only be accessed or modified from within the `BankAccount` class, not from the outside.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). In JavaScript, you can use the `extends` keyword to create a subclass:

```js showLineNumbers
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Call the parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name}, the ${this.breed}, barks.`);
  }
}

const dog1 = new Dog("Rex", "Golden Retriever");
dog1.makeSound(); // Output: Rex, the Golden Retriever, barks.
```

In the above code:

- The `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class, inheriting its properties and methods.
- The `super()` function calls the constructor of the parent class.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means that different classes can be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. In JavaScript, subclasses can override methods from the parent class, providing their own implementation.

```js showLineNumbers
class Shape {
  area() {
    return 0;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(radius) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  area() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(width, height) {
    super();
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const shapes = [new Circle(5), new Rectangle(4, 6)];

shapes.forEach((shape) => {
  console.log(`Area: ${shape.area()}`);
});
// Output:
// Area: 78.53981633974483
// Area: 24
```

Here, both `Circle` and `Rectangle` are subclasses of `Shape`. Although they have different implementations of the `area()` method, we can call `area()` on any shape, and the correct implementation will be invoked.

### Abstraction

Abstraction in JavaScript is typically achieved by using interfaces or abstract classes in other languages, but JavaScript does not have built-in support for abstract classes. However, you can simulate abstraction by creating methods that throw errors when not implemented by derived classes:

```js showLineNumbers
class Vehicle {
  startEngine() {
    throw new Error("Method 'startEngine()' must be implemented.");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  startEngine() {
    console.log("Engine started!");
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.startEngine(); // Output: Engine started!
// const vehicle = new Vehicle();
// vehicle.startEngine();  // Throws an error: Method 'startEngine()' must be implemented.
```

In this example, `startEngine()` in the `Vehicle` class throws an error if it's not overridden by a subclass.

## Prototype-based OOP in JavaScript

While the `class` syntax provides a cleaner way to write OOP code, JavaScript still relies on prototypes under the hood. Every object in JavaScript has a hidden `[[Prototype]]` object, which allows for inheritance. This is what powers JavaScript’s prototype chain.

### Prototypal Inheritance

In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This inheritance is achieved through a mechanism called prototypal inheritance. Every object in JavaScript has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which points to another object. This object is called the **prototype**. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript will first look for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it there, it will follow the `[[Prototype]]` link and look for the property on the prototype object. This process continues up the prototype chain until the property is found or until the chain ends (with `null`).

#### `__proto__` vs `[[Prototype]]`

- `[[Prototype]]`: This is the internal, hidden property of every object that points to its prototype. This internal link is not directly accessible or visible in the code but is conceptually referred to as `[[Prototype]]` in JavaScript documentation.

- `__proto__`: This is a publicly accessible property that points to the object's `[[Prototype]]`. It allows developers to manually access and manipulate the prototype chain. While it’s not recommended to modify `__proto__ `directly in production code, it’s a useful tool for understanding how inheritance works in JavaScript.

#### Example of Prototypal Inheritance

Let’s go through an example to make this clearer.

```js showLineNumbers
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
};

const dog = new Animal("Rex");
dog.speak(); // Output: Rex makes a noise.
```

1. **The Constructor Function**: `Animal` is a constructor function. When you call `new Animal()`, it creates a new object (`dog`) with the following steps:

   - A new object is created, with its `__proto__` pointing to `Animal.prototype`.
   - The constructor `Animal` is called with `this` bound to the new object.
   - The `name` property is assigned to the new object.
   - The newly created object is returned.

2. **`Animal.prototype`**: The `Animal` constructor function has a `prototype` property. This object contains methods like `speak` that can be shared among all instances of `Animal`.

3. **`__proto__` on Instances**: The `dog` object has an internal `[[Prototype]]`, which is the same as `Animal.prototype`. When you call `dog.speak()`, JavaScript first looks for the `speak` method on the dog object. Since `dog` doesn’t have a `speak` method, it follows the `__proto__` link (which points to `Animal.prototype`) and finds the method there.

#### Prototype Chain

Here’s a breakdown of the lookup process when you try to access a property or method on an object:

1. **Own Properties**: JavaScript first checks if the property exists directly on the object itself.
2. **Prototype Chain**: If the property is not found on the object, JavaScript checks the object's `[[Prototype]]` (accessed via `__proto__`).
3. **Continue Up the Chain**: If the property is not found on the prototype, it checks the next object in the chain, and so on, until it reaches the end (where `__proto__` is `null`).

#### Another example

```js showLineNumbers
const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;
};

const jonas = new Person("Jonas", 1991);

Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
  console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
};

console.log(jonas.__proto__); // Output 1
console.log(jonas.prototype); // Output 2
console.log(Person.prototype); // Output 3
console.log(jonas.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // Output 4
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas)); // Output 5
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person)); // Output 6
```

1. `console.log(jonas.__proto__)`

   - **Output**: This will print the `Person.prototype` object, because the **proto** of `jonas` is set to the prototype of `Person`. It will look something like:

```js showLineNumbers
{
  calcAge: function() { ... }
}
```

2. `console.log(jonas.prototype)`

   - **Output**: `undefined`. The `jonas` object is an instance, not a constructor function, so it does not have a `prototype` property. Only constructor functions have a `prototype`.

3. `console.log(Person.prototype)`

   - **Output**: This will log the `Person.prototype` object, which contains the method `calcAge` you defined earlier. The output will be similar to:

```js showLineNumbers
{
  calcAge: function() { ... }
}
```

4. `console.log(jonas.__proto__ === Person.prototype)`

   - **Output**: `true`. This confirms that the **proto** of `jonas` (the instance) points to the `Person.prototype` object, as expected in JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.

5. `Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas)`

   - **Output**: `true`. `Person.prototype` is indeed the prototype of the `jonas` object, because `jonas` was created using the Person constructor.

6. `console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person))`

   - **Output**: false.: The `Person` constructor function itself does not have its prototype linked to `Person.prototype`. Instead, `Person` is a function and its prototype chain is linked to the Function.prototype. So, `Person.prototype` is not the prototype of the `Person` constructor itself.

#### let's keep diving deep into it

```js showLineNumbers
// Prototypal Inheritance on Built-In Objects
console.log(jonas.__proto__); // Output 1
console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__); // Output 2
console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); // Output 3

console.log(Person.prototype.constructor); // Output 4

const arr = [3, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 9]; // new Array === []
console.log(arr.__proto__); // Output 5
console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype); // Output 6

console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__); // Output 7
```

1. `console.log(jonas.__proto__)`

   - **Output**: `Person.prototype`.
   - **Explanation**: jonas is an instance of the Person constructor function. Therefore, `jonas.__proto__` points to `Person.prototype`.

2. `console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__)`

   - **Output**: `Object.prototype`.
   - **Explanation**: `Person.prototype` itself is an object, and all objects in JavaScript inherit from `Object.prototype`. So, `jonas.__proto__.__proto__` points to `Object.prototype`.

3. `console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__)`

   - **Output**: `null`.
   - **Explanation**: `Object.prototype` is the top of the prototype chain, and it does not have its own prototype. So, `jonas.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__` is `null`.

4. `console.log(Person.prototype.constructor)`

   - **Output**: `Person`.
   - **Explanation**: The constructor property of `Person.prototype` points back to the Person function itself. This is how JavaScript maintains a reference to the constructor function from an object's prototype.

5. `console.log(arr.__proto__)`

   - **Output**: `Array.prototype`.
   - **Explanation**: `arr` is an array, and all arrays in JavaScript inherit from `Array.prototype`. So, `arr.__proto__`points to`Array.prototype`.

6. `console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype)`

   - **Output**: `true`.
   - **Explanation**: This confirms that `arr.__proto__` is indeed `Array.prototype`, meaning the array `arr` inherits its methods (like `push`, `map`, `filter`) from `Array.prototype`.

7. `console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__)`

- **Output**: `Object.prototype`.
- **Explanation**: `Array.prototype` itself is an object, and as with all objects, it inherits from `Object.prototype`. So, `arr.__proto__.__proto__` points to `Object.prototype`.

#### Extending Built-in Objects

One of the powerful features of prototypal inheritance is the ability to extend built-in objects like `Array`, `Object`, or `Date`. For example, you can add custom methods to `Array.prototype` so that all arrays in your code will have access to the new methods:

```js showLineNumbers
Array.prototype.first = function () {
  return this[0];
};

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.first()); // Output: 1
```

Here, `first()` is added to `Array.prototype`, meaning all arrays in your JavaScript environment now have access to this method.

## Conclusion

JavaScript offers a flexible approach to Object-Oriented Programming, allowing developers to use both class-based and prototype-based OOP styles. Mastering OOP principles in JavaScript helps you write more structured and maintainable code, making it easier to scale applications as they grow.

Prototypal inheritance is one of JavaScript's most distinctive and powerful features. It allows objects to inherit from other objects, making it easier to share properties and methods. Understanding how prototypes work under the hood is crucial for mastering JavaScript, as it provides a foundation for working with more advanced concepts like ES6 classes, which are syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance.
