Enhanced object literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), offer a more concise and expressive way to define objects in JavaScript. These enhancements streamline object creation and improve code readability by reducing redundancy and adding powerful new features. This article covers the key features of enhanced object literals and provides practical examples.

## Key Features of Enhanced Object Literals

### 1. Shorthand Property Names

With enhanced object literals, you can use shorthand notation for properties when the property name matches the variable name.

#### Example

```js showLineNumbers
const name = "Alice";
const age = 30;

const person = {
  name, // Equivalent to name: name
  age, // Equivalent to age: age
};

console.log(person);
// Outputs: { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
```

### 2. Method Definitions

You can define methods directly in objects using a more concise syntax.

#### Example

```js showLineNumbers
const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

person.greet();
// Outputs: Hello, my name is Bob
```

### 3. Computed Property Names

You can use expressions within square brackets to define property names dynamically.

#### Example

```js showLineNumbers
const key = "dynamicKey";

const obj = {
  [key]: "This is a dynamic property",
};

console.log(obj.dynamicKey);
// Outputs: This is a dynamic property
```

### 4. Object Destructuring with Default Values

You can destructure objects with default values, which helps in handling missing properties.

#### Example

```js showLineNumbers
const user = {
  name: "Charlie",
  age: 40,
};

const { name, age, country = "Unknown" } = user;

console.log(name); // Outputs: Charlie
console.log(age); // Outputs: 40
console.log(country); // Outputs: Unknown
```

## Conclusion

Enhanced object literals provide a more concise and expressive way to define and work with objects in JavaScript. By utilizing shorthand property names, method definitions, computed property names, and other features, you can write cleaner and more readable code. Understanding these enhancements helps in leveraging modern JavaScript features and improving overall code efficiency.
