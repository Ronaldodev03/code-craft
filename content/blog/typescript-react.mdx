TypeScript is a powerful addition to React applications, enabling developers to catch errors early and create more reliable codebases. This article will explore how to use TypeScript effectively with React, focusing on typing states, objects, arrays, using Record and Partial, combining types, and creating subsets of types. We'll walk through practical examples and best practices for leveraging TypeScript to enhance your React projects.

## Typing States in React

One of the core features of React is state management, and TypeScript makes it easy to ensure your state types are consistent and well-defined.

### Typing Primitive States

For simple state types, such as numbers or strings, you can provide the type directly to the `useState` hook:

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Typing state as a number
  const [count, setCount] = useState < number > 0;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Typing Object States

For more complex states, such as objects, defining an interface or type can provide better structure and clarity.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

// Define a type for the state
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email: string;
};

function UserProfile() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    email: "john@example.com",
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {user.age}</p>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Typing Arrays in React

Arrays are a common data structure in React applications, especially when dealing with lists of items. TypeScript allows you to define the type of elements within an array, ensuring type safety and preventing common errors.

### Typing Arrays with Primitive Types

To type an array of primitive types, such as strings or numbers, you can use the generic `Array<T>` syntax or the shorthand `T[]`.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

function StringList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<string[]>(["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]);

  const addItem = (item: string) => {
    setItems([...items, item]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={() => addItem("New Item")}>Add Item</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Typing Arrays with Objects

When dealing with arrays of objects, you can define an interface or type for the objects within the array.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

type Task = {
  id: number;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
};

function TaskList() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([
    { id: 1, description: "Learn TypeScript", completed: false },
    { id: 2, description: "Build a React app", completed: true },
  ]);

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task) => (
          <li key={task.id}>
            {task.description} - {task.completed ? "Completed" : "Pending"}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Using Combined Types

TypeScript allows you to create complex types by combining multiple types. This is particularly useful when working with APIs or complex data structures.

### Example of a Combined Type

Suppose you have a schema that defines different user types and you want to create a combined type that represents either of these user types.

```ts showLineNumbers
type TUsersSchema = {
  titulars: {
    juridical: { name: string; companyName: string }[];
    physical: { name: string; surname: string; age: number }[];
  };
};

// Combined type representing an entry that could be either a juridical or physical person
type Entry =
  | TUsersSchema["titulars"]["juridical"][number]
  | TUsersSchema["titulars"]["physical"][number];

// Function to process a single entry
const processEntry = (entry: Entry) => {
  if ("companyName" in entry) {
    console.log(`Processing company: ${entry.companyName}`);
  } else {
    console.log(
      `Processing individual: ${entry.name} ${entry.surname}, age: ${entry.age}`
    );
  }
};

// Function to format an array of entries
const formatEntries = (
  entries: Entry[]
): Array<{ type: string; info: string }> => {
  return entries.map((entry) => {
    if ("companyName" in entry) {
      // Formatting for juridical persons
      return {
        type: "juridical",
        info: `Company: ${entry.companyName}, Contact: ${entry.name}`,
      };
    } else {
      // Formatting for physical persons
      return {
        type: "physical",
        info: `Name: ${entry.name} ${entry.surname}, Age: ${entry.age}`,
      };
    }
  });
};

// Sample data
const users: TUsersSchema = {
  titulars: {
    juridical: [
      { name: "John Smith", companyName: "TechCorp Inc." },
      { name: "Jane Doe", companyName: "Innovate LLC" },
    ],
    physical: [
      { name: "Alice", surname: "Johnson", age: 28 },
      { name: "Bob", surname: "Brown", age: 35 },
    ],
  },
};

// Create a combined array of juridical and physical entries
const combinedEntries: Entry[] = [
  ...users.titulars.juridical,
  ...users.titulars.physical,
];

// Process and format entries
combinedEntries.forEach(processEntry);
const formattedEntries = formatEntries(combinedEntries);

console.log(formattedEntries);
// Output:
// [
//   { type: "juridical", info: "Company: TechCorp Inc., Contact: John Smith" },
//   { type: "juridical", info: "Company: Innovate LLC, Contact: Jane Doe" },
//   { type: "physical", info: "Name: Alice Johnson, Age: 28" },
//   { type: "physical", info: "Name: Bob Brown, Age: 35" }
// ]
```

In this example, `Entry` is a combined type that can be either a juridical or a physical person from the schema. This allows us to write functions that can handle both types seamlessly, with TypeScript ensuring that the properties of each type are accessed correctly.

## Typing Complex State with Arrays

You can also type complex state that involves arrays of specific values or objects. This is especially useful when you have predefined types for array elements.

### Example of Typing a State with Specific Array Values

Let's consider a scenario where you want to maintain an array of states representing different types of "apoderate" (representatives) that can be either physical or juridical.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

// State type representing different types of "apoderate"
const [personApoderateTypes, setPersonApoderateTypes] = useState<
  Array<"apoderate-physic" | "apoderate-juridic" | null>
>(Array(5).fill(null));

// Update function for the state
const updateApoderateType = (
  index: number,
  type: "apoderate-physic" | "apoderate-juridic" | null
) => {
  setPersonApoderateTypes((prevTypes) =>
    prevTypes.map((t, i) => (i === index ? type : t))
  );
};
```

In this example, the state `personApoderateTypes` is an array that can hold specific string values or `null`. The `updateApoderateType` function allows us to update a specific index of the state array, ensuring that only the allowed types or `null` can be assigned.

## Using `Record` to Type States

`Record` is a TypeScript utility type that represents an object type with specific keys and values. It's useful when you have a dynamic state structure where keys are known, but values are of a specific type.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

// Using Record to type a state with dynamic keys and boolean values
const [formStatus, setFormStatus] = useState<Record<number, boolean>>({});
// const [formStatus, setFormStatus]= useState<{ [key: number]: boolean }>({}); <-- this is equivalent

const updateFormStatus = (formIndex: number, status: boolean) => {
  setFormStatus((prevStatus) => ({
    ...prevStatus,
    [formIndex]: status,
  }));
};
```

## Using `Partial` for Optional Properties

`Partial` is another TypeScript utility type that makes all properties of a type optional. It's useful when dealing with forms or objects where all fields are not required upfront.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

// Define a type for a complex object
type Product = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description?: string;
};

// Using Partial to make all fields optional in the state
const [product, setProduct] = useState < Partial < Product >> {};

// Update function to handle partial updates
const updateProduct = (updatedFields: Partial<Product>) => {
  setProduct((prevProduct) => ({ ...prevProduct, ...updatedFields }));
};
```

## Combining Types

TypeScript allows you to combine types using intersection (`&`) and union (`|`) operators. This is useful when a component or a function needs to handle multiple types or a combination of types.

### Using Intersection Types

Intersection types are used when you want an object to have all the properties of multiple types.

```ts showLineNumbers
type Address = {
  street: string;
  city: string;
};

type Contact = {
  email: string;
  phone: string;
};

// Combining types using Intersection
type User = Address & Contact;

const user: User = {
  street: "123 Main St",
  city: "Anytown",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "123-456-7890",
};
```

## Using Union Types

Union types are used when a variable or parameter can be of multiple types.

```ts showLineNumbers
type LoadingState = "loading" | "success" | "error";

const [status, setStatus] = useState < LoadingState > "loading";

const handleClick = () => {
  setStatus("success"); // Can be "loading", "success", or "error"
};
```

## Creating Subsets of Types

Sometimes, you may want to create a subset of a type for more specialized use cases. TypeScript's utility types like `Pick` and `Omit` help in such cases.

### Using `Pick`

`Pick` creates a new type by picking a set of properties from an existing type.

```ts showLineNumbers
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
};

// Creating a new type with only selected properties
type UserProfile = Pick<User, "name" | "email">;

const userProfile: UserProfile = {
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane@example.com",
};
```

### Using `Omit`

`Omit` creates a new type by omitting a set of properties from an existing type.

```ts showLineNumbers
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
};

// Creating a new type without the "id" property
type UserWithoutId = Omit<User, "id">;

const userWithoutId: UserWithoutId = {
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane@example.com",
  age: 25,
};
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Managing Complex Form States

Using TypeScript with React can significantly enhance how you manage form states by providing precise typing.

```ts showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

type FormData = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age?: number;
};

function FormComponent() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState < Partial < FormData >> {};

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData((prevData) => ({
      ...prevData,
      [name]: value,
    }));
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <input name="firstName" onChange={handleChange} />
      <input name="lastName" onChange={handleChange} />
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Example 2: Using Subsets of Types

In larger applications, you may have several components that need only a subset of a type's properties. Using `Pick` and `Omit` can make your components more reusable and type-safe.

```ts showLineNumbers
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
};

type UserDisplayProps = Pick<User, "name" | "email">;

const UserDisplay: React.FC<UserDisplayProps> = ({ name, email }) => (
  <div>
    <p>Name: {name}</p>
    <p>Email: {email}</p>
  </div>
);
```

### Example 3: Handling Arrays of Complex Types

Let's say you're building a to-do list application where each to-do item has a complex structure. Typing these arrays ensures that each item conforms to the structure defined by a type.

```ts showLineNumbers
type Todo = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
  details?: string;
};

function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([
    { id: 1, title: "Learn TypeScript", completed: false },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Build a To-Do App",
      completed: false,
      details: "Include TypeScript types",
    },
  ]);

  const toggleTodoCompletion = (id: number) => {
    setTodos((prevTodos) =>
      prevTodos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.title} - {todo.completed ? "Completed" : "Pending"}
            <button onClick={() => toggleTodoCompletion(todo.id)}>
              Toggle
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
