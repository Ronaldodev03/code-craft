In JavaScript, functions are a fundamental aspect of the language, and mastering concepts like first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures will significantly improve your understanding of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities. In this article, we’ll explore these three concepts with practical examples and highlight how they are used in JavaScript. {/* and TypeScript. */}

## First-Class Functions

JavaScript treats functions as _first-class citizens_, meaning they are treated like any other data type. Functions can be:

- Assigned to variables.
- Passed as arguments to other functions.
- Returned as values from functions.

### Assigning Functions to Variables

Since functions are first-class citizens, they can be assigned to variables:

```js showLineNumbers
const greet = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet("Ronaldo")); // Outputs: Hello, Ronaldo!
```

In this example, the function `greet` is assigned to a variable, just like any other value. It can then be invoked by calling the variable as if it were the function itself.

### Passing Functions as Arguments

Functions can also be passed as arguments to other functions. This is commonly used in functions like `setTimeout` or event listeners:

```js showLineNumbers
function executeFunction(fn) {
  fn();
}

const sayHello = () => console.log("Hello, World!");
executeFunction(sayHello); // Outputs: Hello, World!
```

Here, `sayHello` is passed as an argument to `executeFunction`, which then executes the passed function.

#### Another example

```js
const oneWord = function (str) {
  return str.replace(/ /g, "").toLowerCase();
};

const upperFirstWord = function (str) {
  const [first, ...others] = str.split(" ");
  return [first.toUpperCase(), ...others].join(" ");
};

// Higher-order function
const transformer = function (str, fn) {
  console.log(`Original string: ${str}`);
  console.log(`Transformed string: ${fn(str)}`);
  console.log(`Transformed by: ${fn.name}`);
};

transformer("JavaScript is the best!", upperFirstWord);
// Outputs:
// Original string: JavaScript is the best!
// Transformed string: JAVASCRIPT is the best!
// Transformed by: upperFirstWord

transformer("JavaScript is the best!", oneWord);
// Outputs:
// Original string: JavaScript is the best!
// Transformed string: javascriptisthebest!
// Transformed by: oneWord
```

In this example, the `transformer` function accepts a string (`str`) and a function (`fn`) as parameters. It logs the original string, the transformed string (which is produced by applying the function `fn` to the string), and the name of the function that was used for the transformation.

The `oneWord` function removes all spaces from a string and converts it to lowercase, while the `upperFirstWord` function capitalizes the first word of a string while leaving the other words unchanged.

When the `transformer` function is called, it passes the string to either `oneWord` or `upperFirstWord`, transforming the string accordingly and logging the process.

**Note**: `oneWord` uses the `.replace()` method with a regular expression `/ /g` to find all spaces (`g` stands for "global," meaning it looks for all occurrences, not just the first one) and replaces them with an empty string.

### Returning Functions from Functions

A function can also return another function:

```js showLineNumbers
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Outputs: 10
```

In this example, `multiplyBy` returns a new function that multiplies a given number by the specified factor. The function returned is then stored in the `double` variable.

## Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns a function. These are common in JavaScript, especially with methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Using `map`

The `map` function is a higher-order function that transforms each element of an array based on a callback function:

```js showLineNumbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this case, the callback function passed to `map` multiplies each element by itself.

### Using `filter`

The `filter` method is another higher-order function that returns an array containing only the elements that match the condition in the callback:

```js showLineNumbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Outputs: [2, 4]
```

The callback function here returns `true` for even numbers, which are then included in the `evenNumbers` array.

### Practical Example: Custom Higher-Order Function

You can create your own higher-order functions, like a logger that logs a message before executing a given function:

```js showLineNumbers
function logExecution(fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    console.log(args); // array due to rest operator
    console.log(`Executing function with arguments: ${args}`); // console.log(`${args}`) outputs args.toString() implicitly
    return fn(...args); // spread operator
  };
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const loggedAdd = logExecution(add);

console.log(loggedAdd(5, 10));
// Outputs: [5,10]
//          Executing function with arguments: 5,10
//          15
```

Here, `logExecution` is a higher-order function that returns a new function. This new function logs the arguments before calling the original function (`add` in this case).

## Closures

A closure is created when a function is declared within another function and accesses variables from the outer function's scope. This mechanism allows the inner function to "remember" the state of its surrounding environment, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures are powerful because they enable functions to have private variables, maintain state, and encapsulate behavior. In JavaScript, closures are used in many common patterns, including callback functions, event listeners, and module patterns.

### Practical Example: Private Variables and State Maintenance

Closures allow for private variables and state maintenance by keeping certain variables hidden from the outside scope. Here's a common use case for closures: creating a counter with private state:

```js showLineNumbers
const createCounter = function (init) {
  let x = init;
  return {
    increment: () => (x += 1),
    decrement: () => (x -= 1),
    reset: () => (x = init),
  };
};

const counter = createCounter(0);
console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 1
console.log(counter.reset()); // 0
```

In this example, the `createCounter` function returns an object containing methods that can increment, decrement, or reset the internal `x` variable. This variable is private and can only be accessed and modified through the methods, thanks to the closure.

### Another Example: Tracking State Across Function Calls

Closures also make it easy to preserve state across multiple function invocations:

```js showLineNumbers
const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };
};

const booker = secureBooking();

booker(); // Outputs: 1 passengers
booker(); // Outputs: 2 passengers
booker(); // Outputs: 3 passengers
```

In this case, `secureBooking` returns a function that increments the `passengerCount` variable each time it is called. Even though `secureBooking` has finished execution, its internal state (the `passengerCount` variable) is maintained through the closure. This pattern is useful for managing state in a controlled and encapsulated way.

### Another Example: Using Closure and default parameters

JavaScript allows setting default values for function parameters, which can be particularly useful for preventing `undefined` or unnecessary error handling when a function is called without certain arguments. Let’s take a look at an example:

```js showLineNumbers
"use strict";

const bookingSystem = function () {
  const bookings = [];

  return {
    createBooking(flightNum, numPassengers = 1, price = 199 * numPassengers) {
      const booking = {
        flightNum,
        numPassengers,
        price,
      };
      console.log(booking);
      bookings.push(booking);
    },

    getBookings() {
      return bookings;
    },
  };
};

const bookingApp = bookingSystem();

bookingApp.createBooking("LH123");
// Output: { flightNum: 'LH123', numPassengers: 1, price: 199 }

bookingApp.createBooking("LH123", 2, 800);
// Output: { flightNum: 'LH123', numPassengers: 2, price: 800 }

bookingApp.createBooking("LH123", undefined, 1000);
// Output: { flightNum: 'LH123', numPassengers: 1, price: 1000 }

console.log(bookingApp.getBookings());
// Output: All stored bookings in the array
```

### Asynchronous Behavior with Closures

Asynchronous operations, such as those involving `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or Promises, can interact with closures in interesting ways. Since asynchronous operations don’t execute immediately, they can lead to unexpected results if closures capture variables in an unexpected state.

Here’s an example using `setTimeout` and `var`:

```js showLineNumbers
function x() {
  console.log(i); // undefined, because i is hoisted but not yet assigned
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i); // All will log 5, because i is shared across all iterations
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}

x();
```

#### What's happening here?

- **var in a for loop**: When you use `var`, the variable `i` is not block-scoped (it is function-scoped), meaning it is shared across all iterations of the loop. By the time the `setTimeout` function runs, the loop has already finished running, and `i` has reached the value `5`. There is only one instance of the variable `i` throughout the function. All loop iterations share this single variable reference.

- **Closure issue**: The arrow function inside `setTimeout` captures the reference to `i`, not its value at the time of the iteration. Since `i` continues to increment, by the time the callback is executed after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 seconds, `i` will always be `5`.

Here’s a fixed example using `setTimeout` and `let`:

```js showLineNumbers
function x() {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i); // This will log 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}

x();
```

#### What's happening now?

- **let in a for loop**: `let` is block-scoped, which means that for each iteration of the loop, a new instance of `i` is created. Each `setTimeout` callback now captures the value of i at that specific iteration, rather than referencing a shared `i`.

- **Closure with let**: When the arrow function inside `setTimeout` is executed, it correctly uses the value of `i` that was assigned during that specific iteration. Each `setTimeout` has its own copy of `i` thanks to the block-scoping of `let`.

Here’s an alternative fix using an IIFE

```js showLineNumbers
function x() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    (function (i) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i); // This will log 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
      }, i * 1000);
    })(i); // Immediately pass the current value of i
  }
}

x();
```

#### What's happening here?

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**: This solution works by creating a new scope for each iteration using an IIFE. Every time the loop runs, we pass the current value of `i` into the IIFE, which immediately invokes itself and creates a separate scope with its own copy of `i`.

- **Closure with IIFE**: In this case, the closure is formed inside the IIFE, where `i` is immediately captured with the correct value for that iteration. The `setTimeout` function now has access to this unique `i` for each loop iteration.

- **Why this works with var**: Since each IIFE creates its own function scope, it breaks the shared reference problem that `var` would normally cause. The `setTimeout` function receives the correct value of `i` because it's passed into the IIFE.

### Example of Closure with `setTimeout` in React

Consider the following example where a closure is used with `setTimeout` in a React functional component:

```js showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

const TimerComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    // `handleClick` has access to the `count` variable through closure
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(count);
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Log Count After 1 Second</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TimerComponent;
```

#### How It Works

1. **Closure Creation**: When you click the "Log Count After 1 Second" button, the `handleClick` function is called. Inside `handleClick`, there's a `setTimeout` function that logs the `count` variable to the console after 1 second.

2. **Accessing Variables**: The `setTimeout` callback function has access to the `count` variable from the `handleClick` function’s scope. This is possible due to closures. Even though `handleClick` finishes executing when you click the button, the `setTimeout` callback retains access to `count` because `count` is in the lexical scope of `handleClick`.

3. **React State Updates**: If you click the "Increment" button after clicking "Log Count After 1 Second," the `count` value in the `setTimeout` callback may not reflect the latest state if the state update hasn't been processed yet. This happens because the `count` variable captured by the closure is the one that was present when `handleClick` was called.

#### Potential Issue with Closures

In React, using closures with asynchronous operations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially with state updates. The example above can potentially log an outdated value of `count` if the state has changed after the `setTimeout` was set but before it executes.

#### Handling State Updates in Closures

To handle state updates correctly, especially in cases where you need the latest state, you can use functional updates or use a `useRef` hook to store the current value of `count`. Here’s an improved version using `useRef`:

```js showLineNumbers
import React, { useState, useRef } from "react";

const TimerComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const countRef = useRef(count);

  // Update the ref whenever the count changes
  React.useEffect(() => {
    countRef.current = count;
  }, [count]);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(countRef.current); // Accesses the latest count value
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Log Count After 1 Second</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TimerComponent;
```

In this version:

- `countRef` is a ref that keeps track of the latest `count` value.
- `useEffect` updates `countRef` whenever `count` changes.
- The `setTimeout` callback uses `countRef.current` to access the latest value of `count`.

  This approach ensures that you always get the most recent state value even if `setTimeout` executes later.

## Differences Between First-Class Functions, Higher-Order Functions, and Closures

- **First-Class Functions**: Functions are treated as values. They can be passed around like any other data type.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
- **Closures**: Functions that retain access to variables from their outer scope, even after the outer function has completed execution.

## Conclusion

Understanding first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures is essential for writing clean, efficient JavaScript code. These concepts form the foundation of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities, allowing for greater flexibility and expressiveness in your code. As you continue to explore JavaScript, React, and TypeScript, you’ll encounter these patterns frequently, so mastering them will significantly improve your development skills.
