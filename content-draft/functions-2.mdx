In JavaScript, functions are a fundamental aspect of the language, and mastering concepts like first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures will significantly improve your understanding of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities. In this article, we’ll explore these three concepts with practical examples and highlight how they are used in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## First-Class Functions

JavaScript treats functions as _first-class citizens_, meaning they are treated like any other data type. Functions can be:

- Assigned to variables.
- Passed as arguments to other functions.
- Returned as values from functions.

### Assigning Functions to Variables

Since functions are first-class citizens, they can be assigned to variables:

```js showLineNumbers
const greet = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet("Ronaldo")); // Outputs: Hello, Ronaldo!
```

In this example, the function `greet` is assigned to a variable, just like any other value. It can then be invoked by calling the variable as if it were the function itself.

### Passing Functions as Arguments

Functions can also be passed as arguments to other functions. This is commonly used in functions like `setTimeout` or event listeners:

```js showLineNumbers
function executeFunction(fn) {
  fn();
}

const sayHello = () => console.log("Hello, World!");
executeFunction(sayHello); // Outputs: Hello, World!
```

Here, `sayHello` is passed as an argument to `executeFunction`, which then executes the passed function.

### Returning Functions from Functions

A function can also return another function:

```js showLineNumbers
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Outputs: 10
```

In this example, `multiplyBy` returns a new function that multiplies a given number by the specified factor. The function returned is then stored in the `double` variable.

## Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns a function. These are common in JavaScript, especially with methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Using `map`

The `map` function is a higher-order function that transforms each element of an array based on a callback function:

```js showLineNumbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this case, the callback function passed to `map` multiplies each element by itself.

### Using `filter`

The `filter` method is another higher-order function that returns an array containing only the elements that match the condition in the callback:

```js showLineNumbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Outputs: [2, 4]
```

The callback function here returns `true` for even numbers, which are then included in the `evenNumbers` array.

## Practical Example: Custom Higher-Order Function

You can create your own higher-order functions, like a logger that logs a message before executing a given function:

```js showLineNumbers
function logExecution(fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    console.log(`Executing function with arguments: ${args}`);
    return fn(...args);
  };
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const loggedAdd = logExecution(add);

console.log(loggedAdd(5, 10));
// Outputs: Executing function with arguments: 5,10
//          15
```

Here, `logExecution` is a higher-order function that returns a new function. This new function logs the arguments before calling the original function (`add` in this case).

## Closures

A closure is created when a function is declared within another function and accesses variables from the outer function's scope. This mechanism allows the inner function to "remember" the state of its surrounding environment, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures are powerful because they enable functions to have private variables, maintain state, and encapsulate behavior. In JavaScript, closures are used in many common patterns, including callback functions, event listeners, and module patterns.

### Practical Example: Private Variables and State Maintenance

Closures allow for private variables and state maintenance by keeping certain variables hidden from the outside scope. Here's a common use case for closures: creating a counter with private state:

```js showLineNumbers
const createCounter = function (init) {
  let x = init;
  return {
    increment: () => (x += 1),
    decrement: () => (x -= 1),
    reset: () => (x = init),
  };
};

const counter = createCounter(0);
console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 1
console.log(counter.reset()); // 0
```

In this example, the `createCounter` function returns an object containing methods that can increment, decrement, or reset the internal `x` variable. This variable is private and can only be accessed and modified through the methods, thanks to the closure.

### Another Example: Tracking State Across Function Calls

Closures also make it easy to preserve state across multiple function invocations:

```js showLineNumbers
const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };
};

const booker = secureBooking();

booker(); // Outputs: 1 passengers
booker(); // Outputs: 2 passengers
booker(); // Outputs: 3 passengers
```

In this case, `secureBooking` returns a function that increments the `passengerCount` variable each time it is called. Even though `secureBooking` has finished execution, its internal state (the `passengerCount` variable) is maintained through the closure. This pattern is useful for managing state in a controlled and encapsulated way.

## Closure in React

Closures are also frequently used in React components, particularly when handling state or event listeners. For instance, closures are useful when accessing component state in asynchronous functions:

```js showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

const CounterComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementAfterDelay = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1); // `prevCount` is captured by closure
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementAfterDelay}>Increment in 1 second</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```

In this example, the `setTimeout` function creates a closure that captures the `prevCount` variable, ensuring the correct value is used when incrementing the state.

## Differences Between First-Class Functions, Higher-Order Functions, and Closures

- **First-Class Functions**: Functions are treated as values. They can be passed around like any other data type.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
- **Closures**: Functions that retain access to variables from their outer scope, even after the outer function has completed execution.

## Conclusion

Understanding first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures is essential for writing clean, efficient JavaScript code. These concepts form the foundation of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities, allowing for greater flexibility and expressiveness in your code. As you continue to explore JavaScript, React, and TypeScript, you’ll encounter these patterns frequently, so mastering them will significantly improve your development skills.
