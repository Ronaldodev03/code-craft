JavaScript provides various data types to store and manipulate different kinds of values. These data types are categorized into primitive and non-primitive (or reference) types. In this article, we'll explore these categories, their characteristics, and how they are used in JavaScript.

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. JavaScript has seven primitive data types:

1. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
2. String: Represents sequences of characters.
3. Boolean: Represents logical values true or false.
4. Undefined: Represents an uninitialized variable.
5. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
6. Symbol: Represents unique identifiers (introduced in ES6).
7. BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision (introduced in ES11).

### Example of Primitive Data Types

```js
const number = 42;
const string = "Hello, World!";
const boolean = true;
let undefinedVar;
const nullVar = null;
const symbol = Symbol("unique");
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

console.log(typeof number); // "number"
console.log(typeof string); // "string"
console.log(typeof boolean); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefinedVar); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof nullVar); // "object" (special case)
console.log(typeof symbol); // "symbol"
console.log(typeof bigInt); // "bigint"
```

## Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, include objects, arrays, and functions. These types are mutable and can hold collections of values or more complex entities.

1. Object: Used to store collections of key-value pairs.
2. Array: A special type of object for storing ordered collections.
3. Function: A special type of object that can be invoked.

### Example of Non-Primitive Data Types

```js
const object = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function greet() {
  return "Hello, World!";
}

console.log(typeof object); // "object"
console.log(typeof array); // "object"
console.log(typeof greet); // "function"
```

## Differences Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types

### Immutability vs. Mutability

- Primitive types are immutable. Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. Operations on primitives return new values.
- Non-primitive types are mutable. The value of an object, array, or function can be changed after creation.

### Storage and Copying

- Primitive types are stored directly in the variable and are copied by value.
- Non-primitive types are stored as references. When assigned or passed to a function, a reference to the memory location is copied, not the actual value.

### Example: Copying Primitive vs. Non-Primitive Types

```js let primitiveA = 10;
let primitiveB = primitiveA;
primitiveB = 20;
console.log(primitiveA); // 10

let objectA = { key: "value" };
let objectB = objectA;
objectB.key = "new value";
console.log(objectA.key); // "new value"
```

In the example above, changing primitiveB does not affect primitiveA because they are copied by value. However, changing objectB affects objectA because they reference the same memory location.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between primitive and non-primitive data types is essential for effectively working with JavaScript. Primitive data types are simple and immutable, making them straightforward to use and predict. Non-primitive data types offer flexibility and complexity, allowing the creation of more sophisticated data structures and functions. Mastering both types enables developers to write efficient and robust JavaScript code.
